5 5|7 7|[ Efficacy of fixed combination amlodipine / valsartan in hospitalized patients with hypertensive disease ]
5 5|7 7|Efficacy and tolerability of fixed amlodipine / valsartan combination was studied in 86 patients with hypertensive disease hospitalized in departments of general internal medicine or cardiology .
